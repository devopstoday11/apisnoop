* Purpose
  Organize repo to have focused domains and org files that relate only to that domain.  This is to help avoid accidents by over-tangling in org files, and to make the repo easier to understand
* Process  
** Isolate the areas that need fixing
  We could reorganize the folder structures to  have the various components at a top level, and each one contains its own app and deployment info 
  
  #+name: possible structure
  #+begin_example
    | Auditlogger
      - app
      - deployment
      -index.org
    | hasura
      - app
      - deployment
      - index.org
    org
    readme.org
  #+end_example
  
  it's a possible, and discussing it with the team we unanimously like it...so we're doing it.
** [/] Figure out what we don't need
*** apps
**** openapi
**** kubemacs
     this is a submodule, and not needed in our repo anymore.
     
**** .env_sample
**** docker-compose.yml
**** pgpass_sample
**** traefik.yaml
*** deployment
**** k8s
***** hh
***** kubemacs
***** kubemacs.org
***** nginx-ingress 
***** zz

*** kustomize
*** org
** [0/5] Fix these areas
*** TODO Auditlogger
*** TODO Hasura
*** TODO webapp
*** TODO postgres
*** TODO pgadmin
** Test is works
